## Introduction
This is a multiple trivia quiz about the character Sheldon Cooper from the show "The Big Bang Theory". This is a web based game that was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Users of this game will need to answer the correct questions about Sheldon!

This game is targeted towards people who are fans of the acclaimed tv series.

## UX

### User Stories

* As a user, I want a clear understanding of the game rules and how to win.
* As a user, I want to see my score progress.
* As a user, I want to see how many questions the game has.
* As a user, I want to be able to navigate throughout multiple game screens and back to the home screen.

### Site Goals

* Create a quiz game site that is easy to navigate through.
* Create a site that is simple in appearance by adding basic colours and layouts.
* Provide the game with some humour for a more meaningful user experience.


* Icons:

- Font Awesome was also used in the creation of this project by providing the icons for all of the player options, navigation and audio buttons.

* #### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to create wireframes of how the product would look as you can see I went for a very simple and easy to understand design.

#### Game Screen

- The Game screen is where users can experience the sites main game.
- As the user progresses through each question their score increments if they answer correctly. If the player doesnt answer correctly the score wont increment but the question bar will.


#### Navigation

- The game and highscores page  have a home icon that allows the user to return to the home screen. This allows the user to navigate to play the game or see highest score.


#### Audio

- When clicked on, the icon changes it's colour to red if the answer it's wrong and when the answer its correct the colour changes to green and plays a sound.
